        CARES</h5>
      <p>We at UrbanFit Clothings cares about the environment. Even at a small scale company, We hope to make an impact to the environment as we believe in "One Earth. One Home."
        This means we are using Eco-friendly clothings made from natural fibers, No pesticides or chemicals used but breathable and soft.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What is Eco-Friendly Clothing anyway?</strong> It starts in our warehouse and we decided to make an eco-friendly fabrics that are organic cotton (is grown without poisonous pesticides), hemp, linen, wool, and silk.</p>

      <p><strong>What it is for our customers?</strong> We explained our side, now we are giving reasons for you to make a contributions to the environment by choosing our products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h5>Good for your health</h5></li>
        <p>Production of typical cotton requires a lot of <strong>Chemicals</strong> - to scare off the animals, to prevent cotton from getting any kind of diseases etc.
        Those are the chemicals that may be the reason for bad allergies, constant itching, and redness in most unexpected places.
        Buying our eco-friendly clothes, you can forget about the issue. We perfected our crafted based on decades of experiences. Moreover, organic fabrics feel so much better on your <strong>skin.</strong></p>

        <li><h5>Good for your health</h5></li>
        <p>If washed wrong, it will be impossible to wear and sometimes discoloration spoiled it. Our eco products are proven that can last long for you to enjoy.</p>
        <li><h5>It is personal</h5></li>
        <p>Our eco-friendly products are not being produced on the assembly lines of the factory. You can be sure that your piece of clothing will be much more unique than others. Thats why we believe there's a style in every story. Be bold. Be you!</p>
        <li><h5>You spread awareness</h5></li>
        <p>You can educate about the others and be an example to present our products made from natural fibers and make people rethink their brand favorites as well. Inspire them with your own styles!</p>
        <li><h5>You spread awareness</h5></li>
        <p>Fashion that is not sustainable adds up to carbon dioxide emissions, poisoning the soil and enriching the landfills with plastic. The jacket one buys at a mass-market shop will not leave the planet in 200 years. 
          The chemicals that are used to dye the clothes and protect the cotton from animals will pollute water, sub-layers of soil and air all at once so buying our eco friendly products can surely help our cause even if its small step we still make a big difference.</p>
